## Projects:
* Final Project Replication of an article titled, "Labor Supply and the Value of Non-Work Time: Experimental Estimates from the Field" by researchers Alexandre Mas and Amanda Pallais
  * Within this project I:
    * Conducted logit regressions to calculate the Marginal Value of Non-Work Time across individual workers with different hours of labor ( $\overline{M V T_{h}}$ )
    * Calculate MVT elasticities over time
    * Run a logit regression of applicants who chose longer hours on effective wages, conditional on whether the treatment is framed traditionally or non-traditionally to verify the author's finding that the framing of wages does not impact MVT
    * Generate elasticities of the labor supply
    * Calculate "ùëß" the  measures of flow value of non-work time relative to a worker‚Äôs marginal product
    * Caluculate "ùëßÃÉ", which  estimates the flow value of non work time relative to market wage
    * Conclude that labor supply = highly elastic at low hours of labor and inelastic at the intensive margin
    * Most Americans either choose to work full time or are unemployed. Part time is very elastic
*** 
* Replication of an research article on "Modelling the Pattern of Structural Change in U.S. Meat Demand" by Giancarlo Moschini and Karl D. Meilke
* Replication of "Modelling trends in food market integration: Method and an application to Tanzanian maize markets" by Author: Bjorn Van Campenhout
