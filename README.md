## Projects:
* Final Project Replication of an article titled, **"Labor Supply and the Value of Non-Work Time: Experimental Estimates from the Field"** by researchers Alexandre Mas and Amanda Pallais
  * **Goals of this project: Measure the relationship between Labor Supply and Effective Wage and quantify the value of free time**
    * Conduct logit regressions to calculate the Marginal Value of Non-Work Time across individual workers with different hours of labor ( $\overline{M V T_{h}}$ )
    * Calculate MVT elasticities over time
    * Run a logit regression of applicants who chose longer hours on effective wages, conditional on whether the treatment is framed traditionally or non-traditionally to verify the author's finding that the framing of wages does not impact MVT
    * Generate elasticities of the labor supply
    * Calculate "ùëß" the  measures of flow value of non-work time relative to a worker‚Äôs marginal product
    * Caluculate "ùëßÃÉ", which  estimates the flow value of non work time relative to market wage
    * Conclude that labor supply = highly elastic at low hours of labor and inelastic at the intensive margin
    * Conclude that most Americans either choose to work full time or are unemployed. Part time work is very elastic
    * Develop policy implications from these results

* Replication of an research article on **"Modelling the Pattern of Structural Change in U.S. Meat Demand"** by Giancarlo Moschini and Karl D. Meilke
     *  **Goals of this project:  empirically test for a structural change in the demand for meat in the US and analyse its' nature**
        * Calulate normalized expenditure using log prices and budget shares
        * Estimate the first difference model using OLS and SUR. Compare results 
        * Understand the significance of restrictions introduced in the restricted SUR model
        * Regress the model on first difference variables
        * Test the Null Hypothesis that there is no structural change
        * Conclude that there is no structural change in the model because under the unrestricted model, the new parameter ‚Ñéùë°, which is no transitive, gave a more correct estimation

* Replication of **"Modelling trends in food market integration: Method and an application to Tanzanian maize markets"** by Author: Bjorn Van Campenhout
   *  **Goals of this project**:
      * Calculate the correlation of price difference across markets
      * Use loops to calculate AR1 models across each market
      * Calculate the half life for each village  
      * Estimate the TAR model
      * Visualize prices changes over time for each trade route 
      * Use this data to conclude which vilalge is least integrated 
      * Conclude that market integration relies on distance, cost of trasnportation, road quality, and frequency of policy checks
      * Develop policy implications from these results
